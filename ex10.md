# Extra Credit

## Write another program that uses math on the letter to convert it to lowercase, and then remove all the extraneous uppercase letters in the switch

## Use the ',' (comma) to initialize letter in the for-loop

## Make it handle all of the arguments you pass it with yet another for-loop

## Convert this switch-statement to an if-statement

## In the case for 'Y' the break is outside the if-statement. What's the impact of this and what happens if you move it inside the if-statement?
