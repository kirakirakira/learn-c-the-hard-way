# Exercise 13 How to Break It

## Use your favorite other language to run this program and use it with as many command line arguments as possible

## Initialize i to 0 and see what that does. Do you have to adjust argc as well, or does it just work? Why does 0-based indexing work here?

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) 
{
    int i = 0;
    
    // go through each string in argv
    // why am I skipping argv[0]? because it's the filename
    for (i = 0; i < argc; i++) {
        printf("arg %d: %s\n", i, argv[i]);
    }
    
    // let's make our own array of strings
    char *states[] = {"California", "Oregon", "Washington", "Texas"};
    
    int num_states = 4;
    
    for (i = 0; i < num_states; i++) {
        printf("state %d: %s\n", i, states[i]);
    }
    
    return 0;
}
```

Output:
```
$ make ex13bk2 && ./ex13bk2 kira is awesome
make: `ex13bk2' is up to date.
arg 0: ./ex13bk2
arg 1: kira
arg 2: is
arg 3: awesome
state 0: California
state 1: Oregon
state 2: Washington
state 3: Texas
```

It works with i initialized to 0 because the first argument is the file name. You don't have to adjust argc in the for-loop test because it is still
doing the same thing it was before, it's just starting at the 0th argument. Before it was skipping the first argument (the 0th, the file name).

## Set num_states wrong so that it's a higher value and see what it does.

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) 
{
    int i = 0;
    
    // go through each string in argv
    // why am I skipping argv[0]? because it's the filename
    for (i = 1; i < argc; i++) {
        printf("arg %d: %s\n", i, argv[i]);
    }
    
    // let's make our own array of strings
    char *states[] = {"California", "Oregon", "Washington", "Texas"};
    
    int num_states = 7;
    
    for (i = 0; i < num_states; i++) {
        printf("state %d: %s\n", i, states[i]);
    }
    
    return 0;
}
```

Output:
```
$ make ex13bk3 && ./ex13bk3 kira is awesome                                                                                           
cc     ex13bk3.c   -o ex13bk3
arg 1: kira
arg 2: is
arg 3: awesome
state 0: California
state 1: Oregon
state 2: Washington
state 3: Texas
state 4: (null)
state 5: �ģ
state 6: (null)
```

Set num_states greater than the actual number of things in the states array. This causes the printf to just print out whatever
junk is next in memory.

# Exercise 13 Extra Credit

## Figure out what kind of code you can put into the parts of a for-loop

## Look up how to use the comma character (,) to separate multiple statements in the parts of the for-loop, but between the semicolon characters (;)

## Read about what a NULL is and try to use it in one of the elements from the states array to see what it'll print

From [C Programming FAQ > NULL, 0, \0 and nul?] (http://faq.cprogramming.com/cgi-bin/smartfaq.cgi?answer=1047589067&id=1043284376)
> NULL is a macro defined in several standard headers, 0 is an integer constant, '\0' is a character constant, and nul is the name of the character constant. All of these are *not* interchangeable:
> NULL is to be used for pointers only since it may be defined as `((void *)0)`, this would cause problems with anything but pointers.
> 0 can be used anywhere, it is the generic symbol for each type's zero value and the compiler will sort things out.
> '\0' should be used only in a character context.
> nul is not defined in C or C++, it shouldn't be used unless you define it yourself in a suitable manner, like:
> `#define nul '\0'`

So I guess a NULL pointer is a pointer that points to nothing. It's used when you don't have an address to assign to the pointer.

Here's what happens:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) 
{
    int i = 0;
    
    // go through each string in argv
    // why am I skipping argv[0]? because it's the filename
    for (i = 1; i < argc; i++) {
        printf("arg %d: %s\n", i, argv[i]);
    }
    
    // let's make our own array of strings
    char *states[] = {"California", NULL, "Washington", "Texas"};
    
    int num_states = 4;
    
    for (i = 0; i < num_states; i++) {
        printf("state %d: %s\n", i, states[i]);
    }
    
    return 0;
}
```

Output:
```
$ make ex13ec3 && ./ex13ec3
cc     ex13ec3.c   -o ex13ec3
state 0: California
state 1: (null)
state 2: Washington
state 3: Texas
```

## See if you can assign an element from the states array to the argv array before printing both. Try the inverse.

Assigning an element from the states array to the argv array before printing both:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) 
{
    int i = 0;
    
    // let's make our own array of strings
    char *states[] = {"California", "Oregon", "Washington", "Texas"};
    
    argv[0] = states[0];
    
    // go through each string in argv
    // why am I skipping argv[0]? because it's the filename
    for (i = 0; i < argc; i++) {
        printf("arg %d: %s\n", i, argv[i]);
    }
    
    int num_states = 4;
    
    for (i = 0; i < num_states; i++) {
        printf("state %d: %s\n", i, states[i]);
    }
    
    return 0;
}
```

Output:
```
$ make ex13ec4 && ./ex13ec4
cc     ex13ec4.c   -o ex13ec4
arg 0: California
state 0: California
state 1: Oregon
state 2: Washington
state 3: Texas
```

Assigning an element from the argv array to the states array before printing both:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) 
{
    int i = 0;
    
    // let's make our own array of strings
    char *states[] = {"California", "Oregon", "Washington", "Texas"};
    
    states[0] = argv[0];
    
    // go through each string in argv
    // why am I skipping argv[0]? because it's the filename
    for (i = 0; i < argc; i++) {
        printf("arg %d: %s\n", i, argv[i]);
    }
    
    int num_states = 4;
    
    for (i = 0; i < num_states; i++) {
        printf("state %d: %s\n", i, states[i]);
    }
    
    return 0;
}
```

Output:
```
$ make ex13ec4 && ./ex13ec4
cc     ex13ec4.c   -o ex13ec4
arg 0: ./ex13ec4
state 0: ./ex13ec4
state 1: Oregon
state 2: Washington
state 3: Texas
```
